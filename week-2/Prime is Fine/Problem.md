Ashwin is interested in prime numbers. Ones he came across a very interesting problem.
It stated that any number more than 2 can be written as sum of two primes. This caught Ashwin's attention
and he decided to make a problem of his own. It stated that at least t prime numbers from 2 to m inclusively 
can be expressed as a sum of three integer numbers: Two neighbouring prime numbers and 1, such as 13 = 7+5+1.

You are to help Ashwin, and find out if he is right or wrong.
