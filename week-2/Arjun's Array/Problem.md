Arjun has an array of m (m is even) integers x1,x2,…,xm. Arjun conceived of a positive integer n. After that, Arjun began performing an operations on the array: take an index j(1≤j≤m) and reduce the number xj by n.

After Arjun performed some (possibly zero) number of such operations, it turned out that all numbers in the array became the same. Find the maximum n at which such a situation is possible, or print −1 if such a number can be arbitrarily large.
